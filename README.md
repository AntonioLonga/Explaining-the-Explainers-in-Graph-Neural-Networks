Repository associated to the paper: ["Explaining the Explainers in Graph Neural Networks: a Comparative Study"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15304.pdf)


## Datasets
In the folder dataset, you can find the networks used in this study!  
Into the folder Dataset you can find a readme explaining how to generate and explore the datasets

## Explanations
It contains the explanations produced by different explainers on different GNNs and datasets. Have a look at the README inside the folder for more info

## Models
It contains all the trained model used in our work! It also contains the classes to load the trained model. The notebook **[GC] Load trained model** show how to load and evaluate a trained model in graph classification.


# Experiments and code 
Work in progress!
